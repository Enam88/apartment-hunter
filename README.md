# House Pricing Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It is an end-to-end solution which includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Flask web app within a Docker container. Additionally, the project will feature interactive data visualizations using Power BI.
